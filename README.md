in this project we implement the first two phases of a
compiler, which are lexical analysis and syntax analysis, for a given piece of code. In the
lexical analysis phase, the input will be source code or program. The output should be in the
form of tokens.We generate the parse table which has entries for each terminal and non-terminals
identified in them.The outcome of the project is to identify the parsing actions taken by the grammar for
proper and invalid source code. Along with this we are generating the parse table for the 
given input.
